Revision history for Perl module Lingua::EN::Syllable

    - Made change suggested in RT#101178, thanks to jgstratt.
      Words ending in -sed like "accused" generally have one fewer syllable
      than the algorithm reports. I think this needs refinement, but it
      seems like it's a general improvement.
